# scripts/check-reflection.sh — ratchet against runtime reflection in main.
#
# clj-kondo is a static analyzer; it never invokes the Clojure compiler, so it
# cannot see reflection or primitive auto-boxing — those are emitted by the
# compiler under `*warn-on-reflection*` (true at the top level of project.clj),
# and only when a namespace actually compiles. `lein lint` never compiles, and
# `lein test` flips the flag off in the :test profile, so neither catches them.
# This wraps `lein check` (which AOT-compiles every main namespace under the
# top-level flag) and fails on any reflection / auto-boxing / primitive-recur
# warning that comes from OUR code.
#
# Every namespace this artifact requires is loaded under the same global flag,
# so reflection from a dependency leaks into the output too — and the biggest
# dependency here is vaelii core, whose whole `impl` tree loads to satisfy one
# `require`. ALLOW below scopes the gate to the source this repo can actually
# fix: core's reflection is core's to answer for, not something a reader out
# here can repair or should be blocked by. Add a third-party dep to ALLOW only
# after confirming its newest release still reflects.
#
# Exit 0 when clean; prints each offending warning and exits 1 otherwise.
# Set REFLECTION_LOG=<file> to lint a pre-captured `lein check` log instead of
# recompiling (used by the script's own self-test).

# (form-init*.clj) is generated, not compiled by `check`, but stays here so a
# stray `lein run` log lints clean too.
