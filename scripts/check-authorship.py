"""The authorship gate: every identity on a pull request is an admitted person.

CONTRIBUTING.md's Conventions section holds that a `Signed-off-by:` may only name
someone who can make the certification, and that a co-author trailer is
human-only. The DCO cannot check that: the app matches a trailer string against
the commit's author field, which is a string matcher and cannot ask whether the
named party is a person. This repo is Apache-2.0 and carries no `license/cla`
check beside it, so the DCO is the whole of the rest.

So this check decides by roster, not by inspection. Every author, committer and
trailer on the pull request must appear in `.github/AUTHORS.roster` on the base
branch, which only a maintainer can write. An account nobody has admitted fails
closed, whatever it is and whatever it says about itself.

An author or committer is matched on the **login** GitHub resolved, never on the
git email beside it: an email is whatever its author set it to, so admitting a
commit because its email is on the roster would let an unadmitted account walk in
under an admitted one's address. The email arm is for trailers, which carry an
email and no account. A trailer carrying neither — a bare `Co-authored-by: Name`
with no `<address>` — matches nothing and is blocked, which is the point: it
names a party the roster has no way to admit.

`--selftest` runs the roster and matching rules against synthetic commits and
needs no network. `lein lint` runs it, so a regression in either shows up before
a pull request meets it.

The heuristics in MARKERS never decide the outcome. They run on a blocked
identity to say *why* it looks the way it does, so the failure names something
actionable instead of a bare login. An account that announces nothing about
itself is blocked exactly as firmly as one whose bio says "construct" — the
roster is the gate, and self-description is only ever an explanation.

Run it locally against a live pull request:
