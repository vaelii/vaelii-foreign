# scripts/lint-versions.sh — the version strings this tree states more than once
# must agree, and the one it publishes must be publishable.
#
# This repo names three coordinates and two of them are cut together:
#
#   1. The engine version.  On a plugin cut, `defproject com.vaelii/vaelii-foreign
#      "V"` and the `[com.vaelii/vaelii "V"]` dependency name one version — the
#      plugin resolves against the engine it was cut with, and the release carve
#      strips the snapshot suffix tree-wide.  Between cuts the dependency names the
#      engine's newest release instead, as `develop` does: the plugin may sit a
#      release out while the engine moves a patch past it, and an engine snapshot
#      matching the plugin's own number is then built by no tree
#      (`bump-dev-tree.sh` sets the engine version after every release).  The
#      engine names no plugin coordinate, so this dependency is the only link
#      between the two versions; `check-versions-agree.sh` in the release tooling holds the
#      plugin at or behind the engine, and on a plugin cut (`--strict-equal`)
#      holds both the version and this dependency to the engine's.  A version
#      nothing reads drifts a whole release unnoticed, which is why this check reads it.
#
#   3. The README's install coordinate is the same string again, so it is held
#      to the same equality rather than to a weaker rule.  Do not
#      treat it as lagging — "it should name the last *release*" — and that is
#      the wrong model: `build-release-tree.sh` strips `-SNAPSHOT` **tree-wide**
#      and guards that none survives, so a dev README saying `0.5.0`
#      carves into a release README saying `0.5.0`, which is exactly right and
#      needs nobody to remember it.  A README naming a bare previous release
#      is the one that carves wrong: it survives the strip untouched and ships a
#      0.5.0 tree advertising 0.4.0.  So the dev tree says snapshot everywhere,
#      the cut says the release everywhere, and this check is what keeps the
#      three spellings one string.
#
# Exit 0 when both hold; prints each disagreement and the fix, and exits 1.

# agrees <own> <other> — is `other` a legal spelling beside this tree's `own`?
#
# Two shapes are legal, because three trees carry this file and they are not the
# same tree.  The cut tree is uniform: the carve has stripped every suffix and
# everything is `X.Y.Z`.  **`develop` and the dev tree between cuts are
# deliberately not uniform.** `bump-develop.sh` rewrites line 1 only, leaving the
# engine coordinate at the version that shipped, and `bump-dev-tree.sh` sets the
# dev tree's engine dependency to the engine's newest release.  The reason matters: a
# contributor cloning develop has to be able to build it, and an engine snapshot
# is on nobody's Clojars.  A check that demanded equality there would turn the
# branch every pull request targets red, which is a worse failure than the drift
# it is looking for.
#
# So: equal, or this tree is a snapshot and the other names a plain release.  That
# second arm is what a released coordinate looks like and nothing else — the drift
# this check exists for left a *snapshot* behind (`0.4.0` beside a dependency
# reading `0.3.0`), so it is still caught, and so is a dependency left at
# an older snapshot in any tree.
