# instead of the snapshot jar `lein install` publishes.
#
# The readers reach into `vaelii.impl.*`, which core is free to change, so
# working against live source is how a break shows up here at the moment it
# lands rather than at the next install.
#
# The sibling is `../vaelii`, which is what `git clone` of the engine produces
# and so what anyone cloning this project has.

# checkouts/ is gitignored, so this link is not committed — rerun after a
# fresh clone. Idempotent (ln -snf). By default the link is skipped with a
# WARN when the target does not exist; pass -f / --force to link anyway (a
# dangling link is harmless and resolves once the core repo is cloned).
